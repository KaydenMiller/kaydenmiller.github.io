## Types Say that You Care

When I see a company specifically one that is using a system that is untyped JS/TS(any) what I see is a company that is saying.
"I have no desire to maintain this product for the future, I just want your money now."
"I don't care if another developer needs to fix this issue for you."
"I don't care to understand my own product or what I am providing to my customers"


"If I am telling a company that they have issues in their software they aren't spending enough time making sure their existing tools are good"
